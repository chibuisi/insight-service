Done
1. fetch a topic
2. fetch items under a topic
3. save topic
4. save topic items
user
1. save user
2. get user by email
3. get users by id
4. get user by ipAddress
subscription
1. subscription api - almost done, doing update subscription
2. create converters for SupportedTopics, UnsubscribeReason
Added unique constraint to topic name
added static method (of) to enums
scheduler
create scheduler for every topic - not done.
schedule - save schedule (default, weekly, monthly, daily), delete schedule, pause/unpause,
1.  delete schedule, pause/unpause
1. get schedule by userId and topic - /schedule?userId=1&topic=motivation done
2. get user schedule - /schedule/user (all, default, daily, weekly, monthly) schedule types
2. get schedules for user and topic - /schedule/user/topic?userId=1&topic=motivation&scheduleType=all
3. get schedules for topic - /schedule/topic?topic=motivation&scheduleType=all
ready schedule table
hourly for daily,weekly,monthly,default schedules
Note: you dont update a schedule. You delete it and add a new one.
weekly schedule frequency is min 1 and max 4. Otherwise advice to use monthly
monthly schedule frequency is min 1 and max 12. Otherwise advice we dont support.
every midnight scheduler --done
if a user unsubscribe then deactivate/remove all schedules --done
schedules - scheduler reads hourly database table and puts on readySchedule table and tries to update
frequency counter to original if required.

Doing
convert every timezone to system timezone before saving time
schedules - scheduler reads hourly database table and puts on queue and readySchedule table
queue


Challenges faced
1. I could not get unique constraint working on the field title. I solved it by
2. Persisting enums to db - solution: created a converter.


Notes:
These are valid formats for cron expressions:

0 0 * * * * = the top of every hour of every day.
*/10 * * * * * = every ten seconds.
0 0 8-10 * * * = 8, 9 and 10 o'clock of every day.
0 0 6,19 * * * = 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM every day.
0 0/30 8-10 * * * = 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30, 10:00 and 10:30 every day.
0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI = on the hour nine-to-five weekdays
0 0 0 25 12 ? = every Christmas Day at midnight
The pattern is:

second, minute, hour, day, month, weekday
So your answer is:

0 0 0 * * *

every Sunday at midnight: - https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19226-01/820-7627/giqlg/index.html
@Schedule(dayOfWeek="Sun", hour="0")
public void cleanupWeekData() { ... }

every Friday at 11:00 PM.
@Schedules ({
    @Schedule(dayOfMonth="Last"),
    @Schedule(dayOfWeek="Fri", hour="23")
})
public void doPeriodicCleanup() { ... }

//to include a ready schedule
if freqCounter > 1
    remove from ready list, reduce to -1 and update in db

//to update freqCounter
if freq != freqCounter
    freCounter = freq
