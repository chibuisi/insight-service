Notes:
These are valid formats for cron expressions:

0 0 * * * * = the top of every hour of every day.
*/10 * * * * * = every ten seconds.
0 0 8-10 * * * = 8, 9 and 10 o'clock of every day.
0 0 6,19 * * * = 6:00 AM and 7:00 PM every day.
0 0/30 8-10 * * * = 8:00, 8:30, 9:00, 9:30, 10:00 and 10:30 every day.
0 0 9-17 * * MON-FRI = on the hour nine-to-five weekdays
0 0 0 25 12 ? = every Christmas Day at midnight
The pattern is:

second, minute, hour, day, month, weekday
So your answer is:

0 0 0 * * *

every Sunday at midnight: - https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19226-01/820-7627/giqlg/index.html
